<h1>Wonders of the World</h1>

This article is about natural and human-made phenomena and structures of the world. For other uses of "Wonders of the World", see Wonders of the World (disambiguation).

Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, in order to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural features and human-built structures.

The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this type, documenting the most iconic and remarkable human-made creations of classical antiquity; the canonical list was established in the 1572 Octo Mundi Miracula, based on classical sources which varied widely. The classical sources only include works located around the Mediterranean rim and in the ancient Near East. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times (five) plus the Sun and Moon.[1]

    Colossus of Rhodes, in the harbor of the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name.

<h1>Lists from other eras</h1>

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers emulated the classical list by creating their own lists with names such as "Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind", and "Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages".[2] It is unlikely that any of these lists actually originated in the Middle Ages since the concept of a "Middle Age" did not become popular until at least the 16th century and the word "medieval" was not invented until the Enlightenment era. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as "later list[s]",[3] suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.

Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Middle Ages but were well known throughout the world.[4][5] Typically representative of such lists are:[3][4][6][7]

    Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, a 2nd-century funerary complex in Alexandria, Egypt.
    Colosseum, a 1st-century amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
    Great Wall of China, a series of defensive fortifications built across the historical northern borders of China, with some segments dating to as early as the 7th century BC.
    Hagia Sophia, a 6th-century cathedral and mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.
    Leaning Tower of Pisa, a 12th-century bell tower in Pisa, Italy.
    Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, a 15th-century pagoda on the south bank of the external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, China.
    Stonehenge, a Neolithic henge monument in Wiltshire, England dated to the 3rd millennium BC.

<h1>Other structures sometimes included on such lists include:</h1>

    Cairo Citadel, a 13th-century Islamic fortification in Cairo, Egypt.[8]
    Cluny Abbey, a 10th-century Benedictine monastery in Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, France.[9]
    Ely Cathedral, a (currently Anglican) cathedral originally built in the 11th century in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.[10]

Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, and there has been debate over how large such a list should be. One of many existing versions of this list was compiled by CNN in 1997:[16]

    Aurora, in the Earth's high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic)
    Grand Canyon, in Arizona, United States
    Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Queensland, Australia
    Harbor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
    Mount Everest, on the border of Nepal and China
    Parícutin volcano, located in the state of Michoacán, Mexico
    Victoria Falls, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe

In 2001, an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New 7 Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments through online votes.[17] The Great Pyramid of Giza, the only remaining wonder of the traditional Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was not one of the winners announced in 2007 but was added as an honorary candidate.[18][19]

A similar contemporary effort to create a list of seven natural (as opposed to human-made) wonders chosen through a global poll, called the New 7 Wonders of Nature, was organized from 2007 to 2011 by the same group as the New 7 Wonders of the World campaign.

    Iguazu Falls, on the border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná
    Hạ Long Bay, in Quảng Ninh province, Vietnam
    Jeju Island, in the Jeju Province of South Korea
    Puerto Princesa Underground River, in Palawan, Philippines
    Table Mountain, overlooking the city of Cape Town, South Africa
    Komodo Island, one of the 17,508 islands that comprise the Republic of Indonesia
    Amazon rainforest, located in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana

<h1>Seven Wonders of the Underwater World</h1>
The Great Barrier Reef

The list of "Seven Wonders of the Underwater World" was drawn up by CEDAM International, an American-based non-profit group for divers that is dedicated to ocean preservation and research. In 1989, CEDAM brought together a panel of marine scientists, including Eugenie Clark, to choose underwater areas which they considered worthy of protection. The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington, D.C., by actor Lloyd Bridges, star of TV's Sea Hunt:[21]

    Palau
    Belize Barrier Reef, Belize
    Great Barrier Reef, Australia
    Deep-sea hydrothermal vents (worldwide)
    Galápagos Islands, Ecuador
    Lake Baikal, Russia
    Northern Red Sea, bordered by Saudi Arabia and Yemen on the eastern shore, and Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, and Djibouti on the western shore
    
    
    
<h1>Seven Wonders of the Solar System</h1>

In a 1999 article, Astronomy magazine listed the "Seven Wonders of the Solar System". This article was later made into a video.[24]

    Enceladus, a moon of Saturn
    The Great Red Spot of Jupiter, a massive and persistent anticyclonic storm in the planet's southern hemisphere
    The asteroid belt, a region of innumerable small solid bodies located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter
    The surface of the Sun
    The oceans of Earth
    The Rings of Saturn
    Olympus Mons, an enormous shield volcano on Mars and the tallest planetary mountain in the Solar System
    
    
<h1>Other lists of wonders of the world</h1>

Many authors and organisations have composed lists of the wonders of the world that have been published in book or magazine form.

Seven Wonders of the World is a 1956 film in which Lowell Thomas searches the world for natural and artificial wonders and invites the audience to try to update the ancient Wonders of the World list.
